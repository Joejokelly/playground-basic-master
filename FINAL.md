Task 1)

I could not print all the patients, as some of the data was not getting a response, and the program used to time out.
So I sill have the where condition in the program.
Patient = “SMITH” (did not have the issue).
But you can remove the where condition, and it would work as well.

Sort condition (first name)  I did have, but there were exceptions as some of the first name was null. (I had used compartor, and override the compareTo method.


Task 2)

-	I have a text file with 20 patients (some of the last name are present in the file)
-	It searches of the content of the file for patients with last name.

-	I have used java Stop watch (as not sure jow to use the interceptor correctly_

The stop watch get the start time, and end time, and I have calculated the average of the 20 patients.

-	I ran the room 3 times as requested,  at the time I am writing the document, I am still working towards finding a solution (to disable the cache).
     Tried some options but that did not work.

-	I have commited work to github.
